Code to calculate Excess Heat Factor and other heat wave characteristics

EHF_GeoCalor_Script.ipynb calculates the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) for a data frame. The EHF is an index created by John Nairn and Robert Fawcett in 2015 (doi:10.3390/ijerph120100227). It is used to define and classify heat waves and is great for any analisys related to the impact on human health. In addition, the code calculates a few other heatwave indicators, like mean humidity and duration, among others, feel free to use only the EHF part if you'd like!
analise_dados_artigo_RBG.ipynb show all the data analysis and visualization that was used for an article that was submitted to the Brazilian Geography Journal (Revista Brasileira de Geografia)
This code was written as a part of a research project (GeoCalor) from LAGAS laboratoty in the University of Brasilia in Brazil (check us out at lagas.unb.br)
I wrote and ran the code on google colab across multiple code cells, but it should work on any IDE of your choice
